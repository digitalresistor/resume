Bert JW Regeer's Resume
=======================

This repository contains my personal resume, typeset with ModernCV using LaTeX.
There are some Github Action automations too to allow me to easily build and
publish updated resumes, and it show cases part of my skillset of automation by
publishing my latest resume on-demand as a release on this repository.

For my latest resume, head over to:
https://github.com/bertjwregeer/resume/releases and download the PDF associated
with the newest release!

Want to fork this repository for your own use case? Please do! Have changes to
the Github Actions? Shoot me over a pull request. Have questions? Reach out, I
swear I don't bite!

Cheers,
Bert JW Regeer
